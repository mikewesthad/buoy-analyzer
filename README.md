# buoy-analyzer

A collection of Processing sketches for analyzing live feeds from the NBDC's network of buoys.

These sketches are powered by [mikewesthad/buoy-cam-scrapper](https://github.com/mikewesthad/buoy-cam-scraper) which is a scrapper that pulls camera images from the [NBDC](http://www.ndbc.noaa.gov)'s network of buoys. Sample imagery will be included in this repository, but you'll need to use the scrapper to generate a more complete image database.

More info coming soon.
